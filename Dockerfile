# This Dockerfile is used to build the container image for the msvc-production microservice.
# It starts with the Alpine Linux base image, installs the necessary ca-certificates,
# copies the compiled application binary from the builder stage to the /app directory,
# sets the command to run the application, and exposes port 8000 for incoming connections.
# Build stage
